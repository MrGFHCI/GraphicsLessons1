/* in this version, I am going to keep the hero in the middle of the JFrame
It will rotate 90 degrees based on "wasd", and shoot in the direction of the ship with the space bar.
Maybe later, I will shoot based on the directional keys.
First rotate - then shoot.

Got it going. The starting point for the bullet is off, depending on the direction of the ship.
Also - only good for one bullet. If you shoot twice, the first bullet goes away.
Also, the bullet needs to rotate based on the direction of the ship.
